# 🧩 Distributed Systems

This repository is dedicated to exploring the principles and implementation of **Distributed Systems**, with a focus on Java Enterprise technologies (Jakarta EE), web services, and event-driven architectures. It bridges theory and cloud-scalable design by progressively building distributed applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand core concepts of distributed computing
- Apply client-server communication using Java EE technologies
- Design modular, service-oriented systems with REST and SOAP
- Use observers, events, and message passing for async interaction
- Build practical systems ready for horizontal scalability

---

## 📚 Theory Coverage

Inside `/theory` you'll find:
- 🔹 Client-Server architecture, thin vs thick clients
- 🔹 EJB lifecycle, dependency injection, session beans
- 🔹 Web services: RESTful and SOAP-based
- 🔹 Message passing, events, and observer pattern
- 🔹 Multi-threading in distributed context

---

## 💻 Practice Modules

The `/practice` folder includes:
- Sample servlet applications and REST endpoints
- Event-based services with EJBs
- Jakarta EE configuration and deployment examples

---

## 🚀 Projects

The `/projects` folder includes:
- 📌 `user-registry-ejb`: distributed user manager using EJBs
- 📌 `distributed-logger`: asynchronous event logger via web services
- 📌 `notification-system`: observer-based notification delivery using message queues

Each project contains:
- Setup scripts and deployment descriptors
- Architectural diagrams
- README with flow and endpoint details

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Jakarta EE` (formerly Java EE)
- `Java`, `JSP`, `Servlets`, `EJB`, `JAX-RS`
- `Tomcat` / `WildFly` or any Java EE compatible server
- `Postman` or similar for API testing

---

## 📎 Notes

This repository helps you transition from monolithic applications to **modular, distributed services**. A key stepping stone toward microservices and cloud-native systems.
